# Food Repo
This is a sample food recipes app for my User Experience students at [KEA](https://kea.dk/).

It retrieves the recipes from [The Meal API](https://www.themealdb.com/api.php).

Management of user signup, user login, and marking/unmarking recipes as favourites takes place by connecting to the [Food Repo User API](https://github.com/arturomorarioja/food_repo_users_api) together with a little handling in `sessionStorage`.

## Technical features
- Multipage responsive application
- Design: use of a triadic colour palette
- Use of the HTML5 `<dialog>` element instead of `alert()`
- Use of semantic HTML, especially in regard to landmark elements
- Implementation of a hamburger menu
- Use of CSS custom variables for colours, fonts and default margins/paddings
- Separation of CSS code into separate files
- JavaScript: Use of ES Modules
- API consumption implemented via `fetch()`
- Embedding of Youtube videos with video existence check
